# Deep Learning

* This folder contains various implementations of neural networks using the TensorFlow v2.1 library. The models range from simple plain deep neural networks to convolutional neural networks, all the way to recurrent neural networks and its variants.

* Various regularization techniques are used throughout all the implementations (L2 regularization, label smoothing, model ensembling, batch/layer normalization, dropout, data augmentation, etc.).

* Various data types are used such as text, images, audio, and 3D-grids.

* These implementations are a sample of the assignments that I completed while part of the Deep Learning (NPFL114) course at Charles University in Prague.
